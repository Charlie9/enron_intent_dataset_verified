Greetings everyone- With a week and a half to go until our second session, I wanted to check in and ask you to begin thinking in your learning teams about how you want to share the information you have been gathering with the larger group.
Greetings: Left you a voicemail.
Guys, I will set up a monthly meeting between myself and you guys to discuss deal flow, priorities and strategy - I think you will find that more effective and I can keep the other meeting small.

He brought it to Calpine's attention immediately upon being contacted by ENA. 3.

He can score from the wing, but he'll end up playing more inside because of his defensive limitations as a small forward.
He didn't get it and we need to get that fixed asap.
He gives them another rebounding wing and a scorer to complement Rashard Lewis, if he re-signs.
He got to climb all over the fire engines and even get into the driver's seat and "drive."
He has a question that I am forwarding to you, since I don't know the answer.
He is going to wait it out another month to see if a new position comes available.
He needs to be able to leave work at a very reasonable hour each day in order to relieve a caregiver who is with his wife while he works.
He said every department at the utility had spent weeks pulling together information for the creditor list, to be submitted to Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali by mid-May.
He said... Let's go out and have some fun tonight.
He will send you the data.
He works with John Thompson and Scott Josey in the upstream capital markets group (producer finance).
He's in DC today at the RTO workshops, but I believe he'll be here tomorrow.

You did a great job of pulling it together.
You don't have to take a day off to attend workshops.
You guys could not work this out - so I offered a compromise position which involved a well coordinated test marketing iniative (this was agreed to by you and John at the offsite): a) the insurance group was to identify the initial 5 to 10 target customer list that ENA would pitch the product to which should give us a determination if this is a commercially viable product; b) John and Scott would facilitate the contact with the customers to ensure a consistent face and story with the customers - if you guys can sit down and come up with an alternative that works for you - great; regardless, John had promised me that he would do everything necessary to facilitate and promote this capability to these customers ASAP; c) both groups would put a deal team together and get out there ASAP; d) if the test marketing of the product is successful; I agree that we need to sit down and discuss how we formally allign the interests of these groups.
